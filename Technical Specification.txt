Quiz Program

----x---Purpose----x---
This Quiz program is built for the class assignment as enlisted in the link
https://thomas-broussard.fr/work/java/courses/project/fundamental.xhtml
The goal specified in the content is as follows:
"This project is proposed to students in order to evaluate their skills for the fundamental period of Java Programming and UML.

This goal is achieved through the realization of a console application (+ GUI as possible bonus), which aims at managing digital quiz preparation and execution."

----x---Scope----x---
The Quiz program fulfills the GUI part with some console messaging as outlined in the assignment. The program also utilizes JDBC for Quiz CRUD operations.

----x---Overview----x---
The program executes in a following manner:

1. JDBC -  for pulling data & processing

2. JavaFX Main
Opens the interface with greeting and presents two tabs

Tab1 - For Playing Quiz
Tab2 - for Level and Topic Selection
----x---Infrastructure Requirements----x---

-JDK 1.8 or above
-JavaFX SDK - 11 & above - with Jar file
- Sqlite3 - latest with Jar file

The program needs to build configuration to include the respective Jar files in the project.

----x---Functional Requirements----x---

The program executes in a following manner:

1. JDBC
   - Drops any pre existing tables in the DB(databse)
   - Creates new tables Question and Answer in DB with appropriate columns
   - Pulls data from QuizData text file and stores in each table and column, both the tables share the same Qid(Question ID) which is also the PRIMARY KEY for each row

2. JavaFX Main
Opens the interface with greeting and presents two tabs

Tab1 - For Playing Quiz
Tab2 - for Level and Topic Selection

Tab1 -> In case no level or topic is selected, it shows an error message
If Level & Topic is selected, throws questions at use in form of MCQ & Open Questions. Both have options of Media content in them. Though the JDBC does not apply CLOB & BLOB for media storage, it stores the URL of the media file.
After quiz ends, the program calculates the score and gives the user the option to exit.

Tab2-> It asks user for Level (Easy & Hard) and topic. Based on the selection, user has the option to 
1. Generate Quiz -> Gives error if any field of level or topic is not selected.
2. Export Quiz-> Based on selection saves the Quiz with Answers in a text file. 
Gives error if any field of level or topic is not selected.
